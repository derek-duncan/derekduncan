I find meeting people one of the most exciting and wonderful parts of life. Thanks for taking some time to look at my information. I would love to become acquainted, so connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/derique_) when you get a chance.

Now, a little about me.

I am married to my love Ginny. We have a 5 year old yellow lab, Maggie.

Exercise has always been a passion/conviction of mine. Currently trying to score a homerun in softball.

I think drawing is one of the most relaxing ways to spend an early morning or lunchtime.

Otherwise, I am fascinated by learning, so I spend my extra time reading books or articles on the ways of business, creativity, and history. I code my ideas into the internet with the most thoughtful designs and experiences the idea inspires.

Please see my continued thoughts and work below. Cheers!
