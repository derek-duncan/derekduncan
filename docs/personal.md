I find meeting people one of the most exciting and wonderful parts of life. It's a pleasure to see you here, and I would love become acquainted! Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DerekDuncan96) when you get a chance.

Now, a little about me.

I am presently engaged to marry my fianc√©, Ginny, in December of 2016, and start our new journey through life together. I am so excited!

I am a serial hobbier (I don't believe this is an official term, though :).

I play ukulele and guitar when I am lost in thought.

Exercise has always been a passion/conviction of mine, so I play basketball and mess around on the pullup bar often. It's a great way to clear the head!

Also, I think drawing is one of the most relaxing ways to spend an early morning or lunchtime. I'm presently sketch-noting at every opportunity I get.

Otherwise, I am fascinated by learning, so I spend my extra time reading books or Medium articles on the ways of business, creativity, and history. I code my ideas into the internet with the most thoughtful designs and experiences the idea inspires.

Please see my continued thoughts and work below. Cheers!
