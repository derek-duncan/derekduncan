#### You're a leaderâ€”first of yourself. You help drive projects in quality and completeness. You can't stand being blocked from getting things done and you know how to get unblocked. You strongly prefer not to be managed.
Of course I'm a leader! I lead worship at church. I started a dang company at 17 years old. I turned down multiple job offers because I wanted Brief Media to succeed.

#### You're willing to ask questions, look dumb, be wrong, take risks, and fail. You like the idea of committing to a project that means you'll need to learn a number of new skills along the way and do things you've never done before.
